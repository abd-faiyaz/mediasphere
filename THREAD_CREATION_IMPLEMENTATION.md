## üöß Pending Implementation

### Image Support (Backend)
To enable full image support, the following backend changes are needed:

1. **Create ThreadImage Model**:
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "thread_images")
public class ThreadImage {
    @Id
    @Column(columnDefinition = "UUID")
    private UUID id;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "thread_id")
    private Thread thread;
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String imagePath;
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String originalName;
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String contentType;
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private Long fileSize;
    
    @Column(name = "created_at", nullable = false)
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    
    // Getters and setters...
}
```

2. **Update Thread Model**:
```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "thread", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<ThreadImage> images = new ArrayList<>();
```

3. **Update ClubController**:
```java
@PostMapping("/{id}/threads")
public ResponseEntity<?> createThread(@PathVariable UUID id,
        @RequestParam("title") String title,
        @RequestParam("content") String content,
        @RequestParam(value = "images", required = false) List<MultipartFile> images,
        @RequestHeader("Authorization") String authHeader) {
    // Implementation for handling multipart form data
}
```

4. **File Storage Configuration**:
   - Configure file upload directory
   - Add file size and type validation
   - Implement file cleanup for deleted threads

5. **Database Migration**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE thread_images (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    thread_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    image_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    original_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_thread_images_thread_id ON thread_images(thread_id);
```

## üîß Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Modal opens when clicking "New Thread" button
- [x] Only club members can create threads
- [x] Title validation works
- [x] Content validation works
- [x] Text-only threads create successfully
- [x] Form resets after successful creation
- [x] Error handling for network failures
- [x] Thread list refreshes after creation
- [x] All animations work smoothly
- [x] Responsive design on mobile devices

### Test Cases for Image Support (When Backend Ready)
- [ ] Image upload with valid file types
- [ ] Image upload with invalid file types
- [ ] Image upload with oversized files
- [ ] Multiple image upload
- [ ] Image preview functionality
- [ ] Image removal functionality

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Image Support (Priority: High)
- Complete backend image handling
- File storage optimization
- Image compression and resizing
- Thumbnail generation

### Phase 2: Rich Text Editor (Priority: Medium)
- Markdown support
- Text formatting toolbar
- Link preview
- Code syntax highlighting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)

## üìù Notes

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for thread creation with an exceptional user experience. The frontend is fully featured and ready for production use, while the backend needs image support to unlock the full potential of the modal's design.

All animations are optimized for performance using framer-motion's best practices, and the component is fully accessible and responsive.
